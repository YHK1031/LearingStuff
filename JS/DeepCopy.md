# How to "deep copy"
It seems like there are some options below
```
1. Object.assign()
2. Spread method
3. JSON.parse and JSON.stringify
4. _.cloneDeep(value) from lodash
5. slice()
```
First and second one does shallow copy for function.</br> 
Third one is possible but there is a function in object.</br>
Fourth one actually DEEP COPY for function!!</br>
