# NoSuchMethodErrors
```
Thrown if an application tries to call a specified method of a class (either static or instance), 
and that class no longer has a definition of that method.
Normally, this error is caught by the compiler; 
this error can only occur at run time if the definition of a class has incompatibly changed.

In case of changing return type or parameters. (It was due to changing return type in my case)
